The objective of this analysis is to better understand the characteristics of Detroit Schools with elevated lead levels as identified via testing in 2016. Data comes from three open data sources: 1) City of Detroit’s ‘Detroit’s Open Data Portal’ ('Charter and EEA Schools Water Testing Results' and 'DPS Water Testing Results'), 2) 'Data from State of Michigan's Center for Educational Performance and Information,' provides information on the location and characteristics of these schools, and 3) A publicly available dataset with information on neighborhood poverty and income levels.
